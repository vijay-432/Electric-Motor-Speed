step 1: read the temperature_data set which have the folowing columns and there detailes

Details of the data: 

Comprehensive csv files containing all measurement sessions and features. Each row represents one snapshot of sensor data at a certain time step. Sample rate is 2 Hz (One row per 0.5 seconds). Distinctive sessions are identified with "profile_id".


Feature set:

ambient
Ambient temperature as measured by a thermal sensor located closely to the stator.

coolant
Coolant temperature. The motor is water cooled. Measurement is taken at the outflow.

u_d
Voltage d-component

u_q
Voltage q-component

motor_speed
Motor speed

torque
Torque induced by current.

i_d
Current d-component

i_q
Current q-component

pm
Permanent Magnet surface temperature representing the rotor temperature. This was measured with an infrared thermography unit.

stator_yoke
Stator yoke temperature is measured with a thermal sensor.

stator_tooth
Stator tooth temperature is measured with a thermal sensor.

stator_winding
Stator winding temperature measured with a thermal sensor.

profile_id
Each measurement session has a unique ID. Make sure not to try to estimate from one session onto the other as they are strongly independent.


Description of Results:
Evaluation Metrics: 
The Random Forest Regression has the lowest Mean Squared Error test (MSE) of 0.000168901, indicating that it performs well in predicting the target variable on unseen data.
The Mean Absolute Error test (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error test (RMSE) are also very low, at 0.003738 and 0.012996, respectively. This indicates that the model's predictions are close to the actual values on average.
The R-squared test (R2) Score of 0.999849 is very close to 1, which means the model explains almost all the variance in the test data.

Overfitting:
The model does not seem to be overfitting, as evidenced by the relatively small difference between the training and test metrics. The overfitting is minimal, which is crucial for better generalization to unseen data.

Generalization:
The Random Forest Regression model shows excellent generalization performance, as indicated by the low values of test error metrics. This means it can make accurate predictions on new data, which is the ultimate goal of any machine learning model.

Robustness:
Random Forest is known for its robustness to outliers and noisy data, making it less sensitive to small fluctuations in the data and reducing the chances of getting misled by outliers.

Model Complexity:
Random Forests are relatively easy to implement and do not require extensive hyperparameter tuning compared to some other models like Neural Networks.
